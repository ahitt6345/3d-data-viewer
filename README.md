# 3d-data-viewer

I am writing a threejs web application to visualize a sample of data. There are two things to focus on, application spheres, and company spheres. Each company belongs to an application sphere and when visualized, will be contained within an application sphere. From there we can visualize other properties of each company: like total funding, or mosaic score based on properties of each sphere, like radius or distance from the center of the sphere.
